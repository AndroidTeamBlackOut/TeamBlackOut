# TeamBlackOut

The TeamBlackOut Updater is an app used to download TeamBlackOut's themed apps. It was created by sebirdman, and donated with full rights to the source. We are currently working on updating it to use open sourced libraries to give it a Material Design feel even for those users on lower APIs.

<b>Plans</b>
-Incorporate a FAB as the download button.
-Material dialogs
-Material Drawer 
-Hamburger/arrow button to open/close nav drawer
